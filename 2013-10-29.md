+ Worry/confusion versus Ambiguity/Questions (the latter is better)
  - communicate a lot

+ Define
+ Carve
+ SMART goals (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, time-bound)

+Curators
  - Tools
    - JSON, CSN, KML, XML
    

+Analyzers
  - ETAS = Epidemic Type Aftershock
    - model that is applied to aftershocks of earthquakes
    - generates curves that matches curves from other data
    - 4 input parameters; 

+ Abstract
  - showing that the ETAS model is not a representative model to use to model earthquakes
  - create a model simpler than ETAS that makes the same, or better, predictions
    - 3 possible outcomes: better, same, worse

+ NEXT TUESDAY: presentation 
+ NEXT THURSDAY: retrospective
