##Stat 157 Presentations:

###Group 1
	imported useful packages in Python to create two text files: Learning and Personal	- created a text output (cleaner than original raw data)
	used R to format the data and analyze
	high numbers: comfortable being a generalist; low numbers: specific learning style
	summaries of learning styles: bar charts

###Group 2
	*analyzed VARK and always/often/sometimes/not often for how often they were administrators, visualizers, etc.
	*Aha moment: collaboration and passing things between each other

###Group 3
	* "What skill are you comfortable being a technical lead in?" versus "VARK"
	* created a table
	* Problem: Visualizer's Python Code was not reproducible; so used R 
	* had a lot of problems with reproducibility, and learned a lot about the process

###Group 4
	*VARK and personal experience in the topics
	*conclusion: maybe people weren't taking the survey seriously
	*reorganize the class so that we have more technical leads
	*learning style scores for each student

###Group 5
	*traits of technical leads; see a somewhat positive correlation between the number of topics someone knows and the likelihood to be a technical lead
	*used a bubble graph to show the extent of knowledge someone knows
	*takeaway: people who are read/write know the least programs

###Group 6
	*focused on one entity

###Group 7
	*tried to see if the distributions were normal; used QQ plots, saw it was skewed
	*scatterplot matrix and heat map of the correlation

###Group 8
	*used R to do the data analysis

###Group 9
	*had several roadblocks
	*was short one person in the team; did not have a curator

###Group 10
	*could not figure out python notebook and so used R
	*focused on types of languages used and learning style (VARK)
	*word cloud: R is the most commonly used 
	  *best graphic
