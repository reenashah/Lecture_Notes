##Inter team Collaboration
prior to taking this course, most students felt that group work primarily meant that individuals perform tasks separately, and the only thing drawing the group together was the final product (compiling all of the work to create a cohesive product)
this class has shown that collaboration requires continual interconnectedness, constant communication, and inherent reliance. It's much more than simply coming together at the end; it's like a "finely tuned machine". It is also the opportunity for leaders to emerge.
frequent meetings help with collaboration; a majority of the groups met at least once a week to update other members and review progress
the largest roadblock in collaboration was the misallocation of tasks among groups. Because some groups took on more responsibility than others, and because there were no deadlines, many groups backloaded their work. This created more stress on the groups that needed to wait for other groups to catch up. This is likely because the nature of the project was so interconnected. 


##Future tools for collaboration
GitHub was an extremely successful communication tool in this course, primarily because of its ability to share projects and code. Most students see themselves using GitHub in the future.
