###iPython; lecture by Fernando Perez (creator)

- computing is the backbone of theory and experiment
- use your own understanding of the problem to alter code
  - you need an environment that you can constantly rearrange and reuse; use lego building blocks to understand what you are trying

####Python: part of a rich ecosystem
- Why iPython?
  - the purpose of computing is insight, not numbers (Hamming)
  - reproducible implies repetition BUT people tend to sacrifice this in order to garner results
  - read evaluate print loop (REPL)
    - what the R console is, terminal is, etc.
    - reads commands, evaluates, and outputs
  - for iPython, broke up the REPL into pieces
    - instead of printing, sends output back to whoever told it to do work
    - embedded in browser
  - mix and match python and R in the same notebook
  - sharing
    - nb viewer
    - URL gives you the rendered version of the notebook; it's a webpaget
